        <p slot="intro">
          In the fast-paced world of blockchain innovation, few stories are as audacious—or as improbable—as the rise of Raz, 
          the enigmatic CEO of Onchain Computer International. In less than a week, his company went from a single retro-inspired NFT 
          to a valuation that turned heads across the financial and tech worlds. Now, with Christmas looming, Raz is looking to take 
          the next step: delivering virtual "onchain computers" to homes across America.
        </p>

        <p class="my-6">
          In an exclusive interview with The Wall Street Journal, Raz explained how it all started with just 10 cents and a bold idea.
        </p>

        <Quote speaker="Raz, your story sounds like the stuff of Silicon Valley legend. Walk us through those first steps.">
          It's pretty simple, really. The way this works is, Onchain Computer International started with $0.10 as the initial capital. 
          That's all you need to deploy an NFT on Base, Coinbase's layer-2 blockchain. Our first product was the "Onchain Computer"—a 
          smiling, retro-style PC as an NFT. It wasn't just a piece of art; it was an idea. And the idea resonated. It sold out in a 
          single day, generating $30,000 in ETH.

        <p class="my-6">
          "The rest happened in real time," said the self-proclaimed trillionaire.
        </p>

        <Quote speaker="That's a staggering leap. What gave you the confidence to scale up so quickly?">
          Selling out the NFT showed me there was real demand for the concept. It wasn't just about the nostalgia or the aesthetic—people 
          believed in the vision. So I decided to take the company public in a way that's only possible in the blockchain world. I deployed 
          the /onchain token and backed it with all $30,000 as liquidity. The rest happened in real time.
        </Quote>

        <Quote speaker="What do you mean by 'the rest'?">
          People were watching me do this onchain. It's all transparent. The token started with a valuation of a few hundred thousand dollars, 
          but as interest grew, that valuation shot up to $100 million within two days. The market validated the concept, and Onchain Computer 
          International hasn't looked back. We've continued selling these computers, both as NFTs and now in physical form, adding ETH to the 
          liquidity pool as we go.
        </Quote>

        <Quote speaker="Let's talk about those computers. What can people expect?">
          While the technical specifications have been public from day one, the features remain a mystery to the public. That's intentional. 
          It's part of the excitement, the allure of what we're building. But I'll say this: they're not just retro in appearance—they're 
          designed to deliver a blend of virtual functionality and nostalgia. And we're committed to delivering them to homes across America before Christmas.
        </Quote>

        <Quote speaker="Scaling virtual products from a blockchain-based origin sounds challenging. What's the strategy?">
          The beauty of blockchain is that it creates community and demand simultaneously. We've already built a base of engaged customers who 
          are invested in the product's success, both literally and figuratively. That base gives us momentum. On the operational side, we're 
          leveraging the liquidity we've built up to ensure manufacturing and distribution meet the demand.
        </Quote>

        <Quote speaker="What's next for Onchain Computer International?">
          We're building an ecosystem, not just a product. The computers are only the beginning. The next chapter is about exploring what it 
          means to be "onchain" in a tangible, everyday sense. These computers are part of that journey, and there's much more to come.
        </Quote>

        <p class="my-6">
          For now, Raz's focus remains on fulfilling his bold holiday promise. Whether Onchain Computer International delivers on its ambitions 
          remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Raz is proving that even the humblest beginnings can lead to extraordinary outcomes in 
          the digital age.
        </p>

        <p class="my-6">
          As blockchain continues to reshape industries, Raz's story serves as a case study in what's possible when innovation, timing, and 
          transparency collide.

          title="Market Surges as Military Base Penguin Makes Daring Escape"
          author="Jane Smith"
          date="December 1, 2024"

          <p>
            In an unprecedented turn of events, global markets experienced an unexpected rally following news of a peculiar incident at 
            the McMurdo Station in Antarctica. A particularly clever Adelie penguin, nicknamed "Agent P" by base personnel, managed to 
            breach security protocols and access the station's main communications center, causing a brief disruption in international 
            weather monitoring systems.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            The S&P 500 surged 2.3% on the news, with crypto markets following suit in what analysts are calling the "Penguin Rally." 
            Trading algorithms, apparently triggered by the unusual combination of keywords in news feeds, initiated a cascade of buy 
            orders across major exchanges.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            "Sometimes the market just needs a good story," said Mark Thompson, chief market strategist at Goldman Sachs. "This 
            penguin has done more for market sentiment than any Fed announcement this quarter."
          </p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            The penguin was last seen waddling towards the coast, reportedly carrying what appeared to be a USB drive. Military 
            officials have declined to comment on the contents of the drive, stating only that their primary concern is the 
            "operational security implications of sophisticated penguin infiltration techniques."
